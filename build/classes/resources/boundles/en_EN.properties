app_description=Parking App is a desktop application designed to carry out\nthe administration of a parking system.\n\nSome of the basic operations it covers are:\n\n- Enter vehicle data into a local database\n- Measure the time the vehicle remains parked.\n- Shows the amount each customer owes based on\nhow long their vehicle has been parked.\n- Update the price by hour.\n- Consult the registers of cash collection and save it in a text file.\n- Consult the vehicle movements and save it in a text file.\n\nWhat this application is not:\n-It is not an accounting system.. It only saves and displays the \nbasic information of the amount entered + the discount.\n-It is not a ticket printing system. It has no output\nto other printing devices.\n-It is not a professional parking system. It only performs\nthe basic operations mentioned above.\n\nDeveloped by Martín Kun - Java Developer.\ncontact me: martinkunbrc@hotmail.com
